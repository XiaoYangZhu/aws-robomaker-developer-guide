# Develop Simulation and Testing Data<a name="how-it-works-simulation"></a>

Robot application developers use simulations to help refine behavior, test robotics algorithms, and perform regression testing\. Simulations use realistic scenarios and detailed virtual environments to model the world and mimic robot behavior in the real world\. 

In AWS RoboMaker, a *simulation application* contains models for the robot, terrain, and assets organized in a scene\. The simulation application is responsible for simulating the physical aspects of a robot such as its sensors, kinematics, and dynamics\. Sensors may include cameras, lidars, and even GPS devices\. Kinematics and dynamics are required to allow the robot to move its joints and wheels and interact physically, such as colliding, with the simulated environment and objects\.

To run a simulation, pair a robot application with a simulation application in a simulation job\. The simulation job can run up to 14 days, and you can restart it with an updated simulation application while it is running\. You can interact with a running simulation by using Gazebo, rviz, rqt, and a terminal for interacting on the command line with the running ROS environment\. For example, you can use Gazebo to see a rendered model of the robot in the environment and use the terminal to listen or send ROS messages to your robot\. 

The robot is unaware that it is inside a simulated environment\. The simulator uses the same interfaces and data types as the robot's physical devices\. This makes it possible to test the same robot software in a simulation and then deploy it to your robots\.
