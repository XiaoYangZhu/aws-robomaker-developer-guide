# Working with Simulation Applications<a name="managing-simulation-applications"></a>

An AWS RoboMaker simulation application contains information about the simulation application\. It includes the Amazon S3 location of a simulation application bundle for the X86\_64 architecture, the name and version of the ROS software suite and rendering engine used\. 

When paired with a AWS RoboMaker robot application in a simulation job, you can interact with your robot using tools like Gazebo and develop simulation and test data\.
